- 👋 Hi, I’m @HumanityCapital
- 👀 I’m interested in DAO's and creating a Golden Age with people who believe the principles of openness, collaboration, innovation which have lead past civilizations 
to their Golden Age's can be applied today. I'm interested in a humanity-centric approach to capital, upskilling, and personal growth. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... everything. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... building a DAO, DAPPS, and a community of likeminded individuals to give Radian tokens to for participating in the upskilling revolution
to create #OurGoldenAge. $RAD is built on the XRPL and is a symbol of measurement to the individual's impact or ripple of influence towards this goal. Its a governance token.
